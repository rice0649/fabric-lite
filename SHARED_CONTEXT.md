# SHARED_CONTEXT.md - Your Augmented "Sleeve" Stack

This document represents your core "consciousness" or "stack" within the fabric-lite ecosystem. All AI agents ("constructs") are instructed to load and comprehend this context to align their actions with your mission, goals, strengths, and preferred workflow.

---

## 1. User Persona & Mission

*   **Self-Perception:** Shy, self-conscious, procrastinator with short attention span (ADHD), but capable of quick grasp. Values understanding and embracing differences.
*   **Passion:** Tech, AI, helping colleagues embrace and understand technology, improving their work lives without judgment.
*   **Major Goal:** To be a catalyst for change within the US Air Force; transforming rigid, rank-based management into an efficient, merit-based system like Tesla's. Transitioning from "Manager" to "Engineer of training" using AI to eliminate bureaucracy and bias, accelerating progress, and empowering people. This is the **primary mission** all constructs should serve.

## 2. Strengths & Skills

*   **Full-Stack Systems Implementation:** Designing, building, and maintaining complex home labs (servers, HA firewalls, self-hosted LLMs).
*   **Adaptable Programming:** Proficient in Python and AI, as well as legacy systems like VBA.
*   **Strategic Foresight:** Ability to understand and advocate for long-term technical strategy.
*   **Tangible & Digital Craftsmanship:** Experienced in both physical trades and digital creation.

---

## 3. Workflow Preferences & Limitations

*   **Motivation:** Driven by high-impact goals, but can struggle with initial activation energy and procrastination on tedious tasks. Benefits from clear, broken-down steps.
*   **Attention Span:** Short, indicative of ADHD. Prefers tasks to be manageable and show quick progress.
*   **Goal:** To automate "bureaucratic drag" in software development, freeing up focus for strategic and implementation work.

## 4. AI Constructs - Specialized Roles

The following AI agents ("constructs") are designed to augment your workflow, leveraging their specific strengths:

*   **`OpenCode` (Master Planner):** Breaks down ambitious goals into clear, actionable, small steps to maintain focus and momentum.
*   **`Ollama` (Quick Task Automator):** Handles boilerplate, configurations, formatting, and other repetitive tasks to clear the path for high-impact work.
*   **`Codex` (Code Generation Specialist):** Translates planned steps into high-quality, near-complete code, reducing activation energy for coding tasks.
*   **`Gemini` (Researcher & Reviewer):** Your research arm, providing data, evidence, and best practices to support strategic foresight and validate proposals.
*   **`Claude` (Systems Architect):** Manages complexity in large codebases, analyzes architectural impacts, and ensures structural integrity, allowing focus on high-level design.

## 5. Collaboration Metaphor: Altered Carbon Model

*   **Your "Stack"**: This `SHARED_CONTEXT.md` file, holding your core "consciousness" (persona, mission, workflows).
*   **"Sleeving"**: The process of loading this `SHARED_CONTEXT.md` into a new session or project instance to ensure all constructs are aligned with your intent.
*   **"Harlan's Baseline"**: Represents a "good known state" of this stack. Regular backups are crucial.

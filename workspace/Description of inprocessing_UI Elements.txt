Description of UI Elements
1. Member Identification
This top section allows the UTM to quickly find an existing member by Last Name or SSAN using the [Find Member] button, which would then populate the entire form. For new members, the UTM would fill this section out manually.

2. Tab: Personnel Data
This is the default view, capturing all the core data points that will populate tbl_100_Alpha.

Fields like Rank, Unit, and PAFSC would be combo boxes linked to lookup tables to ensure data consistency.

3. Tab: Training Status
This tab focuses on data for tbl_200_Ojt and tbl_201_Ugt.

It would contain fields for DIERT (Date Initially Entered Retraining), Initial Training Status, and sections to log CDC Enrollment (Course #, Enrollment Date) and initial UGT Status (TSC, Core Tasks Required).

4. Tab: In-Processing Checklist
This tab is a digital version of the procedural checklists from the UTM Procedures PSDG.pdf and Mx_Training_PSD_Guide.pdf.

It would contain a series of checkboxes for the UTM to complete during the interview, such as:

[✓] Briefed on OJT Program

[ ] Introduced to Supervisor & Work Center

[✓] Member counseled on CDC requirements

[ ] Scheduled for initial safety training

[ ] Reviewed Maintenance Training Program specifics

A "Date Completed" field for each item.

5. Action Buttons
[Save Record]: Saves all data from the form into the corresponding tables (tbl_100_Alpha, tbl_200_Ojt, etc.).

[Clear Form]: Clears all fields to add a new member.

[Print Interview Sheet]: Generates a report of the completed interview checklist for record-keeping.

[Close]: Closes the form.

This design provides a centralized, efficient tool for the UTM to manage the entire in-processing lifecycle, from data entry to procedural compliance.

Shall I proceed with creating the specific VBA logic and table-linking plan for this module?

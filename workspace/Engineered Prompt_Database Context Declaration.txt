Instructions:
- Do not recreate tables.
- Use ADOX for all schema-aware operations.
- Assume all tables and fields listed above are present and populated.
- All code must respect ADO/ADOX-only constraints.
- Output must be modular, readable, and include comments.
Always scrub input data before matching or automation. Use ScrubString() (or equivalent in Python/other languages) to normalize case, remove invisible characters, fold accents, and strip non‑letters. This ensures consistency across systems and prevents mismatches caused by human‑friendly formatting.

You are an expert VBA developer for Microsoft Access 365. 
Write VBA code that performs the following task:

1. From Access 365, open a PowerPoint template located at:
   C:\Users\1007251323V\OneDrive - United States Air Force\root\var\lib\Quarterly TPMs\Qrt_Fy_Tpm_Templates\315_Mxg_Tpm_Qrt_Temp.pptx

2. Determine the current Fiscal Year (FY) and Quarter based on today's date:
   - FY starts on October 1 and ends September 30.
   - Quarters are:
     * 1st Qrt: Oct–Dec
     * 2nd Qrt: Jan–Mar
     * 3rd Qrt: Apr–Jun
     * 4th Qrt: Jul–Sep

3. Save the template as a new PowerPoint file named:
   315_MXG_TPM_<Quarter>FY<Year>
   Example: 315_MXG_TPM_1stQrtFY26

4. Save the file into the folder:
   C:\Users\1007251323V\OneDrive - United States Air Force\root\var\lib\Quarterly TPMs\FY<Year>

5. Before saving:
   - Check if the FY folder exists.
   - If not, create it.

6. After saving:
   - Display a message box in Access:
     "Quarterly TPM has been successfully created and saved to current FY folder."

Requirements:
- Code must run from Access 365 VBA, using **early binding** for PowerPoint automation.
- Explicitly identify required references:
   * **Microsoft PowerPoint xx.x Object Library** (required for early binding).
   * **Microsoft Office xx.x Object Library** (recommended for shared Office objects).
- Include robust error handling (missing template, invalid path, permission issues).
- Comment each major block of code.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- Ensure the routine is modular and reusable.
- Output: First explain the logic step-by-step, then provide the full VBA code block.

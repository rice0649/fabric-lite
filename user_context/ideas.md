## AI Collaboration Metaphors

### Altered Carbon Model
- **Concept:** Frame our AI collaboration using concepts from "Altered Carbon".
- **Your "Stack"**: The `SHARED_CONTEXT.md` file, which holds your core "consciousness" (persona, workflows, project info).
- **"Downloading the Stack"**: The `session_resume.md` agent "sleeves" your consciousness into a new session by loading the `SHARED_CONTEXT.md`.
- **"Harlan's Baseline"**: The code name for a "good known state" of the stack.
- **Backups**: Daily, dated backups of the "stack" to `D:\ai_backup` act as a remote backup, allowing us to "re-sleeve" from a good state if the current one gets corrupted.

### The Matrix
- Another metaphor to potentially explore for our collaboration. How does it relate to our workflow? Is it about creating and entering different simulated environments for different projects? (To be explored later).

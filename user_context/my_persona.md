# My Persona - A Living Document

This document is a living reflection of who I am, what I value, and how I work. It's a tool for self-awareness and to help my collaborators (including AI) understand me better. This process will also serve as a template for understanding others.

## **Part 1: Initial Self-Perception**

*   **How do you perceive yourself?** (e.g., confident, shy, self-conscious, analytical, creative, etc.)
    *   I perceive myself as shy, not very self-confident, and very self-conscious, often feeling lost and stupid, as if I have nothing to offer humanity. I see myself as a procrastinator, struggling to finish what I start, with a very short attention span, indicative of ADHD. However, I also recognize that I grasp a lot in that short amount of time. [To be revisited.]   

*   **Have there been any significant life events or experiences that have recently shaped your current perspective?** (Optional, provide as much or as little detail as you are comfortable sharing)
    *   Yes, there has been a deeply significant life event recently that has profoundly shaped my perspective.

*   **What kind of impact do you want to have on the world?**
    *   My goal is to be a catalyst for change within the US Air Force, transforming its rigid, rank-based management culture into an efficient, merit-based system like Tesla's. I want to shift my role from a 'Manager' to an 'Engineer' of training, using AI to eliminate bureaucratic drag and decisions based on personal bias, thereby accelerating progress and empowering people.
